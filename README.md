# Task

In this task, you'll write a script that has variables and uses `console.log` to print a little story.

## Steps

2. Open this folder in Visual Studio Code.
3. In `story.js`, define three variables that contain a `name`, an `age`, and a `hobby`.
4. Using these variables, print the following story:

   ```
   Mr./Mrs. NAME, in 33 years, you will be AGE_PLUS_33 years old. By then you'll have decades of HOBBY practice!
   ```

Example, if the variables are the following:

- `name`: Mshary
- `age`: 25
- `hobby`: Meditation

The story goes:

```
Mr./Mrs. Mshary, in 33 years, you will be 58 years old. By then you'll have decades of Meditation practice!
```
